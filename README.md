# Overview
This repository contains code to run the front-end portion of the e-commerce application I have been developing. This application uses React and Typescript to create and display pages that displays products and allows users to place orders on them for the shop owner to then fulfill. This front-end portion works in combination with the back-end code contained in my "online-shop-back" repository. This project is a work in progress and is continuously being updated.
